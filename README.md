# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

### 1.Summary
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to stop using a service. By analyzing customer data, we can identify at-risk customers and help the business retain them.

### 2. Inspiration & Problem Statement
The main problem is that losing customers (churn) is expensive for a business. It's much cheaper to keep an existing customer than to find a new one. This project is inspired by the need for an automated way to identify customers who might leave, so the company can take action.

### 3. Proposed Solution & Approach
* **Dataset:** I will use the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset from Kaggle.
* **Models:** I will start with a simple Logistic Regression model and then try a more powerful one.
* **Tools:** The project will be built using Python, with libraries like Pandas for data handling and Scikit-learn for modeling.

### 4. Uniqueness
The project will focus on explaining *why* the model makes its predictions. I will analyze which factors (like contract type or monthly charges) are the most important for predicting churn, providing actionable insights.

### 5. Goals & Deliverables
* **Goal:** To create a model that can accurately predict customer churn.
* **Deliverables:** The final Python code in a notebook and a summary of the key findings.
